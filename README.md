# MKS21X-FinalProject
# January 3rd
             - Created new file
             - Created the GCF function using Euclid's method and recursion
             - Create divide function that returns the quotient of two substrings.
             - Created multiply function that returns the product of two substrings.
             - Created subtract function that returns the difference of two substrings.
             - Created add function that returns the sum of two substrings.
# January 4th
             - Added main that tests RealNumber methods
             - Created sqrt function using Newton's Method
# January 6th
             - Created containsVariable function that determines if the string has a variable in it and what that variable is
             - Implemented Token class, used in the Shunting-Yard Algorithm.
               The Shunting-Yard Algorithm is used to evaluate expressions in PEMDAS order.
# January 7th
             - Modified add to be able to work on strings with a single variable
             - Modified subtract to be able to work on strings with a single variable
             - Modified multiply to be able to work on strings with a single variable
             - Modified divide to be able to work on strings with a single variable
