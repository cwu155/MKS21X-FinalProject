# MKS21X-FinalProject
# Instructions
             - To use this program, please enter the function that you want us to solve
             - The args entered should have a space in between (ie 2x + 3y) or in the format of add 2x 3y
             - This program can currently add, subtract, mulitply, divide, and find the GCF two strings
             - It can also evaluate an expression! (Without variables.)
             - The commands should be written in ALL LOWERCASE!!
             - Please do not simply enter x or y : Enter in the form 1x + 1y
             - You can also solve for x in linear equations (ie 3x + 9871 = 984) To use this this feature, please type in equation (all lowercase) and enter the equation between quotations (see example above)";

# January 3rd
             - Created new file
             - Created the GCF function using Euclid's method and recursion
             - Create divide function that returns the quotient of two substrings.
             - Created multiply function that returns the product of two substrings.
             - Created subtract function that returns the difference of two substrings.
             - Created add function that returns the sum of two substrings.
# January 4th
             - Added main that tests RealNumber methods
             - Created sqrt function using Newton's Method
# January 6th
             - Created containsVariable function that determines if the string has a variable in it and what that variable is
             - Implemented Token class, used in the Shunting-Yard Algorithm.
               The Shunting-Yard Algorithm is used to evaluate expressions in PEMDAS order.
# January 7th
             - Modified add to be able to work on strings with a single variable
             - Modified subtract to be able to work on strings with a single variable
             - Modified multiply to be able to work on strings with a single variable
             - Modified divide to be able to work on strings with a single variable
# January 8th
             - Created calculator class
# January 10th
             - Implemented RealNumbers functions into Calculator class and added instructions to run the functions

# January 13th
             - Finished the Shunting-Yard Algorithm to evaluate expressions.
             - Updated Calculator class to take user input.
# January 14th
             - Fixed bugs in the mulitply and divide functions with mulitple variables
# January 15th
             - Wrote a seperate function that seperates a given equation into two components
             - Created a reverse function
# January 16th
             - Deleted reverse function
             - Wrote a function to evaluate one side of the function
# January 17th
             - Started writing a function to reduce both sides of a function down to its variables
# January 18th
             - Fixed an error with SimplifyFirst
             - Wrote SimplifyVar, which finishes the last step in solving a linear equation
# January 20th
             - Added equation function to calculator
             - Updated instructions
             - Started graph class
             - Updated calculator menu
         
# January 21st
             - Tried to make graph work: did not work :(
